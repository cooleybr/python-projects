# Initial Blockchain Implementation

This basic python app defines a block and a blockchain with basic functionality. The blockchain is initialized with a genesis block and blocks may be appended.

At current, there is no storage mechanism. Block adds are hardcoded with no transactions.

// TODO // 

 - Create endpoints to utilize all functionality
 - Allow custom block creation
 - Define smart contracts
 - Define persistent storage
 - Test various applications
